## The purpose of UX storytelling
>The purpose of UX storytelling is to keep you users in mind when going through the project. When you have a name and a face to look at and consider what they might using the product for you can pinpoint short comings you may have that they might run into. You can also find out what the user value/needs that you may not have considered when doing other research.

## Scenarios & Journey Map

### Dan's Scenario & Journey Map
 
#### Why is Dan using this product
>Dan is using this product so he can connect with his daughter's passion for piano. Ever since his wife passed away his daughter was missing the only person in her life who really connected with her about piano. Dan wants to change this and learn music theory so he can be more involved in his daughter's life. It’s also a new challenge for himself and it’s been a while since he has picked up something new.

#### How is Dan using this product
>Dan uses the product whenever he has a little bit of free time like when he’s in line waiting to pick up his daughter from school or eating lunch at work. He typically accesses the website from his mobile device via the browser called Brave which musictheory.net doesn’t support. He also constantly has to close the website and then when he tries to reopen it he can’t find where he left off because it doesn’t have any way of saving the information for users.
