## The purpose of UX storytelling
>The purpose of UX storytelling is to keep you users in mind when going through the project. When you have a name and a face to look at and consider what they might using the product for you can pinpoint short comings you may have that they might run into. You can also find out what the user value/needs that you may not have considered when doing other research.

## Scenarios & Journey Map

### Dan's Scenario & Journey Map
 
#### Why is Dan using this product
>Dan is using this product so he can connect with his daughter's passion for piano. Ever since his wife passed away his daughter was missing the only person in her life who really connected with her about piano. Dan wants to change this and learn music theory so he can be more involved in his daughter's life. It’s also a new challenge for himself and it’s been a while since he has picked up something new.

#### How is Dan using this product
>Dan uses the product whenever he has a little bit of free time like when he’s in line waiting to pick up his daughter from school or eating lunch at work. He typically accesses the website from his mobile device via the browser called Brave which musictheory.net doesn’t support. He also constantly has to close the website and then when he tries to reopen it he can’t find where he left off because it doesn’t have any way of saving the information for users.

### Emily's Scenario & Journey Map

#### Why is Emily using this product
>Emily is using the product so she can fulfill her childhood dream of learning music theory because her parents couldn’t afford lessons. She wants something that is not in her native language so she can practice her English more but does wish that the website would offer other languages so more people can learn music theory for free.

#### How is Emily using this product
>Emily uses the product when she’s nannying because there are often times where the kids are asleep or playing something so she has some time to kill. She feels like there should be a way for tracking progress/how long the lesson should take like a game seeing how much you have left before you are done with the level and onto the next. She doesn't want to start a level and be mid way because she has a bad memory and will often forget what she learned when she comes back.

## Reflection
>Creating the personas was more challenging than I thought but it made me practice for situations I may come into in the workforce. I won't always know my user super well so I have to learn about them and become them essentially. I really appreciate the entire process because it made me understand how an actual user would use the features I’m planning on creating thus giving me actual stuff to show stakeholders as to why we should be looking into this. I felt that in the future I would want to spend more time figuring out the persona and empathy map as this one felt really hard to do but as with anything the first time doing it will be really hard it can only get better. I felt the project really helped me realize why creating personas are important and how they can show that your project is valuable.
